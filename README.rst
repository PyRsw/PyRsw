PyRsw: Python Rotating Shallow Water Model
===================================

PyRsw is a python solver of the Rotating Shallow Water Model.  
This is an approximate model that can be derived from the full
Bossiness equations in the limit of constant density and strictly
hydrostatic motions. It is more general than the one-layer 
quasigeostrophic model in that it allows for variable Rossby numbers
and can include gravity waves. It is a useful model to study
geophysical fluids.  This consists of the oceans, the atmosphere and
other planetary systems as well.

We hope that this will be of interest both to students and 
researchers in the field.
The aim is to create examples that can illustrate the basic 
physical processes
and documentation that explains it.  

PyRsw is a work in progress and we greatly value peoples comments and
contributions.  

Presently, PyRsw is only pseudo-spectral but there are plans of including
a Finite Volume option.

Pyres is threaded if you have pyfftw installed.  If this is not present than
the fftâ€™s from numpy will be used instead.   Extending this to include
mpi would make things run even faster.
